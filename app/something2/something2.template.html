<h3>HAVE FUN</h3>
<h2>Getting high should be an enjoyable time. If at any point you start feeling like its not then it is time to take a break or find some new people to burn with.</h2>
<h3>Find A Friend</h3>

<h2>Find yourself a frient, a friend who also enjoys marijuana. While its not terrible to smoke alone it can be so much more fun when you have someone to chat with.</h2>
<h3>Know Your Limits</h3>

<h2>Everyone has their limits and its important to know yours. No, you canâ€™t over dose and die from weed but you can indeed get too high and thats not not a pleasant experience.   If you feel pressured to keep going then its time to revisit #2.</h2>
<h3>Bring A Lighter</h3>

<h2>While its not the end of the world if you don’t remember yours, having your own lighter can be a huge advantage. Plus if everyone brings a lighter then no one has to worry about lighter thieves.</h2>
<h3>Be Upfront If You Get Weird While Smoking</h3>

<h2>Everyone handles weed different and some smokers can get terrible anxiety attacks if they smoke too much, others might get really hyper or what ever else. If you know you might get a little weird make sure to warn someone just incase you get to that point. (RS)</h2>
